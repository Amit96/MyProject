*The project is a calculator.

*It has the following features:
	1. Evaluate Expression.
	2. Operations on large integers.
	3. Finding roots of quadratic equation.
	4. Solving linear equations.

1. To evaluate an expression, correct expression must be entered. The calculator will give wrong answer  if wrong expression is entered. The opening and closing CIRCULAR brackets must be properly placed.
	The following math functions and their way of use are:
		sin()		sin()
		cos()		cos()
		tan()		tan()
		log()		log()
		sqrt()		sqr()
		sinh()		snh()
		cosh()		cnh()
		tanh()		tnh()
		asin()		asn()
		acos()		acn()
		atan()		atn()
		exp()		exp()
		ceil()		cel()
		floor()		flr()
		log10()		ltn()

2. For operations on large integers(integers larger than the int datatype can handle), ONLY INTEGERS must be entered. Negative integers can be entered.
   Operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication can be done.

   * After each operation, a new integer can be entered to perform an operation with the answer of the 	   previous operation.	

3. For solving quadratic equations, values of coefficients must be entered.

4. Linear equations in two as well as three variables can be solved.
	Values of coefficients must be entered for it.

* Pressing the number corresponding to exit will exit from the program.
