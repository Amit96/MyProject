*The project is a CALCULATOR.

Name: Amit Kamthe

Description: The program can evaluate expressions. It can perform operations like addition, subtraction and multiplication on large integers(integers greater than the integers that an int data type can handle). Finding roots of quadratic equation and solving linear equations in one and two variables can be done too. There is a man_page(.txt file) attached that provides details about the features.
For operations on large integers, negative integers can be entered. The code is split into files. evalexp.c contains code for expression evaluation. lineareq.c contains code for solving linear equations. quadratic.c contains code for quadratic equations and integer.c contains code for operations on large integers.
